# Movie Notice
## Overview
Hi, welcome to Movie Notice project!

One day, my best friend shared a very interesting idea with me. He said that it'd have been great if there was an 
application, that would notify him whenever new episode of his favorite TV show gets released. (some people prefer
to wait for season finale and then watch all the episodes one after another, but he isn't that type of a guy).

So, I decided to develop React application that would be able to offer that service. For me, as a junior front-end 
web developer, this was a great opportunity to strengthen and further expand my knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript (React).

Even though, Movie Notice still lacks some features and development process continues, still, it is ready to be explored by the world.
